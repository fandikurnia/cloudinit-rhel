Installing Cloud Init on RHEL
-----------------------------

*OBSOLETE* - Only worked on RHEL 6.x and since RHEL's official AMI 6u4 now includes CloudInit, it's no longer needed.

Also, this lacked RHEL-specific configuration in /etc, but you could copy it from a 6.4 AMI

This is left up for historical purposes but no support is provided beyond providing the old blog posting upon request.
